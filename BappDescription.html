	PowerMacros is plug-in for BurpSuite proxy. It provides extended functionality of BurpSuite's built-in macros feature. This extension allows you to pipe automated requests (when certain conditions are met) to JavaScript files for pre-processing before being sent outbound. With JavaScript files you load, you can manipulate Burp Suite's automated requests on the fly. PowerMacros integrates powerfully with Burp Suite's features, in particular its target scoping functionality.
